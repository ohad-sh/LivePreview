_size.scss should be stored in your Compass Directory. On Windows, the directory path to the Compass Stylesheet folder is C:\Ruby193\lib\ruby\gems\1.9.1\gems\compass-0.12.2\frameworks\compass\stylesheets\compass.

If you don't add this file to that directory and you try to parse style.scss, you'll get an error. 

SOME IMPORTANT NOTES:
    - The name of your Ruby folder (in this case, Ruby193) is completely dependant on the version of Ruby which you have installed. If you have the latest version of Ruby, the folder may be appended with a different set of digits.
